# Data_Assimilation_TRNN
Application of TLSTM from Yu et. al to the Lorenz 96'/63 model for creating Surrogate models for Data Assimilation

## To generate data, train the model, and
1. Load the TLSTM_Lorenz_generate.ipynb into Google Colab
2. Set paramters in the parameter cell
3. Run the file

Based on the work forked from this <a href =https://github.com/yuqirose/tensor_train_RNN> repository </a> and the paper:
